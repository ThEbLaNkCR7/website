            Cementitious waterproofing is a specialized technique that involves the application of cement-based coatings or admixtures to concrete surfaces. This process creates a waterproof barrier, preventing water penetration 
            and safeguarding structures against the damaging effects of moisture, chemicals, and environmental factors.
            It is the most common method for waterproofing. Its main component is cement, sand, and liquid, 
            some may spend extra to add acrylic addictive membrane to get better bonding and durability. It Is a semi-flexible
             waterproofing system that uses a mixture of cement and other materials to provide the waterproofing characteristics. 
             It provides a good bonding to the structure to protect against water infiltration to seal against damp soil and seepage. 
             This waterproofing membrane does not stretch since it is made of cement. 
             This membrane usually requires 2-3layer of coating to enhance the waterproofing protection to the concrete surfaces.

    Cementitious waterproofing membrane is easy to apply with a trowel, brush, roller or even spray method. This method is often used in internal wet areas, it is a rigid, semi flexible type of waterproofing.
    Since it is commonly used in internal more often, it is not exposed to sunlight and weathering, thus it does not go through contract and expansion process.Cementitious waterproofing is a method used to protect 
    structures from water penetration by applying a cement-based coating or material. It is commonly used in construction to make surfaces such as concrete walls, basements, and foundations impermeable to water.

        <h2 class="heading">How Cementitious Waterproofing Works</h2>
        <p>
            Cementitious waterproofing works by creating a durable, water-resistant barrier on concrete surfaces,
            preventing the infiltration of water and protecting structures from the damaging effects of moisture. 
            The process involves the use of cement-based coatings or admixtures, 
            which work in various ways to enhance the waterproofing properties of the concrete.
            The process of cementitious waterproofing involves the application of a cement-based mixture that forms a waterproof barrier when cured. 
            This mixture is often composed of Portland cement, sand, and chemical additives that enhance its waterproofing properties. 
            The application can be done using brushes, trowels, or sprayers.

        <div class="how">
            <p>
        <h7>Here's an overview of how cementitious waterproofing works:</h7> <br> 
<span>Coatings and Sealants:</span> Cementitious waterproofing coatings are applied directly to the surface of concrete. 
These coatings typically consist of a mixture of Portland cement, various additives, and polymers. 
When applied, the coating forms a protective layer that adheres to the concrete substrate, creating a seamless 
and waterproof surface.
<br>
<br>
<span>Integral Admixtures:</span> Integral waterproofing involves adding specialized admixtures directly into the 
concrete mix during the mixing process. These admixtures may include hydrophobic agents, crystalline compounds,
 or other waterproofing chemicals. As the concrete cures, these additives create a network of water-repelling compounds
  within the concrete matrix, enhancing its resistance to water penetration.
<br><br>
<span>Capillary Blocking:</span> One key mechanism in cementitious waterproofing is the ability to block capillaries
 and pores within the concrete. Water can seep into concrete through capillaries and microscopic pores. 
 The cementitious materials work to fill and seal these openings, preventing water molecules from passing through and 
 ensuring a watertight barrier. 
<br> <br>
<span>Chemical Reaction:</span>
 Some cementitious waterproofing systems rely on chemical reactions to enhance waterproofing. For example, 
 crystalline waterproofing agents react with moisture in the concrete to form insoluble crystals. 
 These crystals fill voids and microcracks, creating an impermeable barrier that hinders water penetration over time.
<br><br>
<span>Flexible and Elastomeric Properties:</span> Certain cementitious waterproofing products exhibit flexible and 
elastomeric properties. This flexibility allows the material to withstand minor movements in the structure without cracking or 
losing its waterproofing effectiveness. It is particularly important in areas prone to structural settling or thermal 
expansion and contraction.
<br><br>
<span>Resistance to Environmental Factors:</span> Cementitious waterproofing is designed to withstand various 
environmental factors, including UV exposure, temperature fluctuations, and chemical exposure. This resilience ensures
 that the waterproofing system remains effective over the long term, providing continuous protection against water damage.
